    "In this practical session you will implement and train several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the Keras framework with a Tensorflow backend. If you are not already familiar with Keras, you can go over the [following tutorial](https://github.com/tueimage/essential-skills/blob/master/keras.md). More detailed information on the different functionalities can be found in the [Keras library documentation](https://keras.io/). \n",

    "You also have to install the Keras deep learning framework (if you have not done so already) by running `conda install keras`. Note that there are two implementations of Keras, one from https://keras.io/ and another one that ships with Tensorflow. Here we use the former. "
